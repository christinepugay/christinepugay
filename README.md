# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Christine!  

Welcome to my GitHub, where I showcase my projects as a Data Analyst!

Here are some projects to get you started:

### [Charting Blood Pressure to Support Physician Diagnosis Using Excel](https://github.com/christinepugay/bloodpressure/tree/main)
In this project, I created a medical charting system that records a patient's blood pressure (BP) results and simultaniously analyzes the results overtime.

### [Employee Database Using SQL](https://github.com/christinepugay/employee_database/tree/main)
In this project, I stored and made an analysis of 1000 mock employees using SQL. 

### [Airbnb Price Prediction Machine Learning Project](https://github.com/christinepugay/Airbnb-Machine-Learning)
As a research assistant, I worked on a machine learning project as a research assistant under a Cal Poly Pomona professor with three other students. The goal of this project is to analyze both qualitative and quantitative data such as number of beds, amenities, and listing reviews to optimize price predicting model for Airbnb listings in the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area.

### [Spam Email Classification](https://github.com/christinepugay/Spam_email_classification)
Here I built a model that can classify spam emails and emails using classification models such as logistic regression model, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Multinomial Naive Bayes.
