# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Christine!  

Welcome to my GitHub, where I showcase my projects as a Data Analyst!

Here are some projects to get you started:

### [Airbnb Machine Learning Project](https://github.com/christinepugay/Airbnb-Machine-Learning)
I am currently working on this machine learning project as a research assistant under a Cal Poly Pomona professor with three other students. The goal of this project is to analyze both qualitative and quantitative data such as number of beds, amenities, and listing reviews to optimize price predicting model for Airbnb listings in the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area. Check out my work!
